# Kindred

Kindred is a simple application to manage contacts. 

The focus in building Kindred is front-end DOM manipulation. In particular, there is a debouncing feature to the search bar such that contacts are filtered after the user finishes typing. No Front-end frameworks were used. 

To get started, run the following:

```
git clone https://github.com/acai777/Kindred.git
```

```
npm install
```

```
npm start
```
