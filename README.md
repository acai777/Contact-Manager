# Contact-Manager

This is my implementation of the JS239 Practice Project. The focus of this project is Front-end DOM manipulation. No Front-end frameworks were used. 

To get started, run the following:

```
git clone https://github.com/acai777/Contact-Manager.git
```

```
npm install
```

```
npm start
```

Go to http://localhost:3000/ to view the page.
