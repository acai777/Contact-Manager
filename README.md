# Contact-Manager

This is my implementation for a simple application to manage contacts. The focus of this project is front-end DOM manipulation. In particular, I added a debouncing feature to the search bar so that contacts are filtered after the user finishes typing. No Front-end frameworks were used. 

To get started, run the following:

```
git clone https://github.com/acai777/Contact-Manager.git
```

```
npm install
```

```
npm start
```

Go to http://localhost:3000/ to view the page.
